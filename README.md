# Pyber_Analysis

### Overview

This analysis is used to show the disparity of Pyber fare rates based on city type.  


### Results

The results are shown in the graph below:

The results for each city type are quite proportional between the three types in correlation to the dates. This data spans from January to April of 2019. The outcome of this data depicts urban areas have the most expensive fares in the US, followed by suburban areas, then finally rural.


### Summary

Some recommendations that come from the results are:

1. The amount of drivers sent to different city types should correlate to these results. There should be more drivers in urban areas vs. rural areas. 
2. Cost of the rides should also correlate to the type of city. Urban trips should be more expensive than rural due to demand.
3. Finally, it may be worth while to investigate why people use Pyber more often during certain times. For example, there was a spike in February. There may be something worth repeating that happened during that month.
